Organizing nodeschool events in New York, NY!

## Events

We held our first nodeschool NYC session on February 23, 2014 at [Huge Inc.](http://www.hugeinc.com/events/node-school) in Dumbo. [@brianloveswords](https://twitter.com/brianloveswords), the lead host and organizer, wrote a great [debrief](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/93#issuecomment-36045066).

We'll be hosting another one soon!
